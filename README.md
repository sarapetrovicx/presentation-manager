# Presentation Manager
Presentation Manager is a Java project designed to handle projects which contain presentations with slides. It allows users to add and delete slides, export presentations to another project, and share presentations with another project.

The project incorporates a number of design patterns including Singleton, Simple Factory, Observer, State Pattern, Factory Method, Command Pattern, and Serialization. This results in a well-structured, scalable and extensible project that can be easily modified to meet changing needs.

## Features
Create new presentations with multiple slides.
Add and delete slides within a presentation.
Export presentations to other projects.
Share presentations with other projects.
Undo/Redo functionality using the Command Pattern.
State Pattern to handle the different states of a presentation (editing, presenting).
Singleton pattern to ensure that there is only one instance of the presentation manager.
Simple Factory and Factory Method patterns to create different types of presentations and slides.
Observer pattern to notify the UI when changes are made to the presentation.
Serialization to save and load presentations.
## How to Use
To use Presentation Manager, simply download the project and import it into your Java IDE of choice. The project is structured in a modular way, with each design pattern implemented in its own package. This makes it easy to understand and modify the code.
